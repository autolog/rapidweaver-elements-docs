# Error Messages

#### `Primary Stack Failed to Convert`

The main stack failed to convert for some reason which prevented any child stack from converting. Check the error on the main stack to see what happened.

#### `ðŸ”‘ The Stacks contain encrypted data`

Some of the stacks data is encryped. This is often caused by the info.plist file containing encrypted data. Try conversion again with a fully unencrypted stack.

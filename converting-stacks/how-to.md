# How to Convert

{% hint style="info" %}
The documentation and process detailed here is for third-party **developers only**.
{% endhint %}

Converting your stacks to Elements is easy. Simply follow these steps to get started.

1. Open RapidWeaver Elements
2. Open the app Settings (command + ,)
3. Navigate to the Developer tab
4. Click the plus button and choose "Convert Stacks to Elements‚Ä¶"
5. Choose single or multiple stacks that you'd like to convert from the open panel.

This will open the stack converter window and RapidWeaver will begin the conversion process. Successfully converted .rwelementpack(s) are automatically encrypted.

To see your converted stack(s), just use the "Reveal Addons Folder‚Ä¶" option in the RapidWeaver menu. The .rwelementpack file will be placed in the following location:

```
Addons > Elements > your-awesome.rwelementpack
```

The resulting .elementpack file is now ready for use and distribution to customers.&#x20;

### stacks Converter

The stacks converter is far more than just a conversion tool, stacks developers have previously had no way to validate their templates and other content. In Elements we decided to tackle this head on and create a tool that can find and report problems in stacks.&#x20;

Regardless of if you plan to ship your stack as an Element, we think all stacks developers will find this tool immensely useful.

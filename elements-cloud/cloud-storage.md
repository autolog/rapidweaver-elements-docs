# Cloud Storage

Every Elements Cloud account comes with 1GB of free cloud storage. This is the perfect place to make backups and upload files for sharing.

### Backup and Share a File

Once [logged into you Account](account-sign-up.md) you can share your open project from the Cloud icon in the Elements Toolbar.

### Converting an Elements App link to a direct download

To generate a direct download link from an Elements App link, simply append the unique identifier from the original link to the elementsapp.cloud URL.

#### Example:

• Elements App Link: [elementsapp://downloadDocument/M1l5heNgT81r](elementsapp://downloadDocument/M1l5heNgT81r)

• Direct Download Link: [https://dl.elementsapp.cloud/g/M1l5heNgT81r](https://dl.elementsapp.cloud/g/M1l5heNgT81r)

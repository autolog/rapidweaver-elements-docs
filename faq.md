# Developer FAQ

{% hint style="info" %}
**RapidWeaver Elements is still in development,** and as such, features can and will change between now and the public launch. The below FAQ is not a guarantee on feature set or compatibility.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Q: What is RapidWeaver Elements?

A: RapidWeaver Elements is taking RapidWeaver in a new direction. It's built from the ground up utilising the latest web technologies, meaning it’s modern, fast, and opens up a world of mind-blowing possibilities. In short, **we're taking drag-and-drop website building to the next level**.

#### Q: When will RapidWeaver Elements be available?

A: RapidWeaver Elements is currently in beta and due to launch publicly in 2023.

#### Q: Are stacks compatible with RapidWeaver Elements?

A: stacks are not compatible with RapidWeaver Elements out of the box. However, developers can use our one-click conversion tool to convert their stacks into Elements.

We've already seen a flurry of activity during the initial developer beta, and some notable stacks developers have commited to supporting Elements.

Using the conversion tool developers will be able to offer customers both a stack and an Element giving the customer the choice to choose the right platform for thier next web project.

#### Q: Is the Elements language the same as the stacks language?

A: Yes and No. While Elements supports the stacks language, it also has its own syntax and language enhancements that can be used while converting or developing new Elements.

#### Q:As a Developer, how do I convert my stacks to Elements?

A: Developers should take a look at our [converting stacks to Elements guide](converting-stacks/how-to.md) along with [Template Overrides](template-language/porting-stacks/enhancements/template-overrides.md) and the [Language Enhancements](converting-stacks/language-enhancements/) that are available.

#### Q: Will end-users be able to convert stacks to Elements?

A: Only the developer version of RapidWeaver will have the conversion tool enabled.

#### Q: Where do I find my stacks that have been converted to Elements?

To see your converted stacks, just use the "Reveal Addons Folder…" option in the RapidWeaver menu. The .elementpack file will be placed in Addons > Elements > your-awesome.elementpack

#### **Q: Will RapidWeaver Elements be able to open older RW Classic Stack based projects?**

Yes, providing third-party developers choose to convert their stacks to Elements. Once this is done, existing Stacks based RapidWeaver Classic projects will open in RapidWeaver Elements.

As an example, the Realmac Software website currently uses the Foundry stacks from Elixir Graphics, one of the most popular Frameworks out there. We converted the Foundry stacks to Elements as a test and because of this, we’ve been able to open up our RapidWeaver Classic project in RapidWeaver Elements, so in theory we can continue developing and managing our website right where we left off.

RapidWeaver Elements currently supports all existing RapidWeaver themes. However, at this time it does not support default page types (Contact Form, File Sharing, Photo Album, Blog, Sitemap, etc). This may change, but at this time content will need to be moved over manually.

# Design System

### Atoms

Atoms represent the most basic elements of a webpage, they are at the foundation of your page design. They include things like, containers, grids, headings, text, and buttons. They are singular items, like lego bricks, the are the core components.

### Components

Components are pre-built sections and layouts, each with their own unique set of features. They include things like, navigation, footer, layouts, and galleries.

Here's a high level illustration on how Atoms and Components differ.

### Mobile First Design

Elements is a mobile first, static website builder. Mobile has now surpassed desktop in global internet usage, Google has switched to Mobile First indexing. thatâ€™s why Elements takes a mobile first approach to website design to ensure your sites work better and rank higher in search results.

We recommend designing at the mobile breakpoint first, and working your way up through the breakpoints to support larger screens.

### Built on Tailwind and AlpineJS

Elements is built upon the popular [Tailwind CSS framework](https://tailwindcss.com/) (and AlpineJS) which makes it a piece of cake to build modern responsive websites.

By standardising on the framework used inside of Elements, we ensure third-party components work great with every website you build.&#x20;

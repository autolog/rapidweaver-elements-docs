# Design System



### Responsive Design

RapidWeaver Elements is built upon the popular [Tailwind CSS framework](https://tailwindcss.com/) (and AlpineJS) which makes it a piece of cake to build modern responsive websites.

### Mobile First Design

RapidWeaver Elements is a mobile first, static website builder. Mobile has now surpassed desktop in global internet usage, Google has switched to Mobile First indexing. thatâ€™s why RapidWeaver Elements takes a mobile first approach to website design to ensure your sites work better and rank higher in search results.

We recommend designing at the mobile breakpoint first, and working your way up through the breakpoints to support larger screens.

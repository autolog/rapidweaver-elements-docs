# Design System



### Responsive Design

RapidWeaver Elements is built upon the popular [Tailwind framework](https://tailwindcss.com/), which makes it a piece of cake to build complex responsive layouts.

### Mobile-first Design

By default, RapidWeaver Elements uses a mobile-first breakpoint system. We recommend designing at the mobile breakpoint first, and working your way up through the breakpoints to support larger screens.

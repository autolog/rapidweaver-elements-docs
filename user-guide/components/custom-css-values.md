# Custom CSS Values

A lot of elements support a "custom sizing" option for you to specify the exact size of an element, this can be things like width, height, and placement.

When typing into the custom size box, it's useful to remebet that anything native css supports, we support! So vh, px, rem, %, etc.

Here's some examples:

* 250px - Make the width (or hight) 250px wide.
* calc(100vw-20px) - 100% viewport width - 20px.
* 100vw - 100% of the viewport width.
* 80vh - 80% of the viewport height.

# Grid

The Grid Element is a powerful layout system based on CSS Grid that allows you to create complex two-dimensional grid-based layouts for web pages. It provides a precise way to position and align elements within a grid container, making it easier to design responsive and flexible layouts.

With the Grid Element, you can define rows and columns, control their sizes, and place items anywhere within the grid. You can also set the grid-gap for adding spacing between grid cells, you can even create nested grids.

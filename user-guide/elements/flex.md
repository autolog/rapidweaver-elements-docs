# Flex

The Flex Element is based on the Flexbox CSS module that provides a flexible way to distribute space among items within a container. It is designed for one-dimensional layouts, such as arranging elements in a single row or column. With Flexbox, you can easily create responsive and dynamic layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

description: ExtraContent support for Classic third-party Themes
---

# ExtraContent

The ExtraContent concept was intitally created by Adam Merrifield (of SeyDesing) for RapidWeaver in 2008. While this concept is now a little dated, it's still very useful is you're using an older third-party classic style theme.

We've rewritten and included the ExtraContent Element over to Elements as a connivence for users migrating from Classic to Elements.

The ExtraContent Element allows users to easily add additional content areas to their websites beyond the standard page layout. With ExtraContent, you can seamlessly incorporate custom code, widgets, images, and other elements into various regions of your website, enhancing its functionality and flexibility.

### Compatibility

The ExtraContent Element will work with a lot of third-party themes, however you'll need to check with the theme developer if this functionality is supported.

Themes from Elixir Graphics, 1LD, ThemeFlood, MultiThemes, and others all support ExtraContent.

# Container

The Container Element serves as a wrapper or holder for other elements. It is commonly used to group and organise related content. The Container Element can be used to apply spacing or create space around elements.

{% hint style="info" %}
The container width can be set up globally for each breakpoint in the [Screens area](../theme-studio/screens.md) of the Theme Studio.
{% endhint %}

### Layout

#### Align

Align allows you to set the alignment of the items with the container.&#x20;

#### Padding

### Advanced

#### Visible

Visually show and hide the element. Please note the element will still be visible in the html, but not visible on the page.

You can browse all the available Tailwind classes over in the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/).

# Publishing

When you’re ready to publish your website, you'll need to configure the.  Elements can publish to the following locations and services:

* Local (to your Mac)
* FTP
* SFTP / FTPS
* Amazon S3

Publishing your site is an exciting moment: you’ll be able to enter a website address into Safari and see the fruits of your work.

Depending on who your hosting provider is, you may need to tweak a few options in Elements before you publish your website. This is entirely normal and is simply due to web hosts having different requirements when publishing your site.

Most importantly, you’ll need to remember that the details you enter into Elements are supplied by your hosting provider, not Realmac Software. Many hosting providers will require you to use publishing details that differ from any details you may use to access their control panel in a web browser. While this may be frustrating, it’s designed to keep your private information safe. If you are at all unsure about what to enter into Elements, drop your hosting provider an email, and they’ll be able to advise you.

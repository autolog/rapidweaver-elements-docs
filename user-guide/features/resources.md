# Resources

Website resources include anything from image files to pds and folders. All of your resources can be managed right inside RapidWeaver Elements.

### How to add Resources

Open the resources list in the left hand sidebar, and drag and drop in files (and folders), from the Finder.&#x20;

The structure and naming of your files will be the same in-app and when it's exported to the finder.

# Introduction

The Elements language allows third-party developers to create custom Elements that can be used within the RapidWeaver Elements layout engine. Custom elements are a bundle of files, usually a mixture of HTML, JS, CSS, JSON, and images.

The only thing you need to start building your own custom Elements is a copy of RapidWeaver and a text editor. Previous web development experience is recommend, but not required.

The Elements language is still in development, features and documentation will be updated as development progresses.

# Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

Elements is a simple, yet powerful **templating language** for RapidWeaver Elements.

The Elements language allows third-party developers to create custom Elements that can be used within the RapidWeaver Elements layout engine. Elements (.rwelementpack) are a bundle of files, usually a mixture of HTML, JS, CSS, JSON, and images.

The only thing you need to start building your own custom Elements is a copy of RapidWeaver and a text editor. Previous web development experience is recommend, but not required.

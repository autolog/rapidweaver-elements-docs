# Distribution

RapidWeaver Element Packs (.elementspack) are highly optimised encrypted bundles compiled from a RapidWeaver Dev Pack (.elementsdevpack) and ready for distribution. Use the developers tools inside of RapidWeaver to convert from a DevPack into a compiled Element Pack.

Compiled Elements can only be shipped using the RapidWeaver Elements Distribution platform.

{% hint style="info" %}
Element Dev packs can be shared publicly, but please be aware these are unencrypted and require a Professional Elements license to run.
{% endhint %}

# Distribution

RapidWeaver Element Packs (.elementspack) are highly optimised encrypted bundles compiled from a RapidWeaver Dev Pack (.elementsdevpack). Use the developers tools inside of RapidWeaver to convert from a DevPack into a compiled Element Pack.

Element Packs allow you to include a single or multiple add ons inside of it, this can include things like Components, Resources, Themes, and more.

Compiled Elements can only be shipped using the RapidWeaver Elements Distribution platform.

{% hint style="info" %}
Element Dev packs can be shared publicly, but please be aware these are unencrypted and require a Professional Elements license to run.
{% endhint %}

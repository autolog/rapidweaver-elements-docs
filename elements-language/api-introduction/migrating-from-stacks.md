# Migrating from Stacks

{% hint style="info" %}
This document is not finishedâ€¦ It will provide examples on how to convert a stack into a native Element Component.
{% endhint %}

To covert your Stack to an Element Component it will unfortunately need to be re-written. However, once you get familiar with how the properties JSON file is constructed, you'll find converting your stack info.plist over to this new format fairly straightforward.

Porting your Stack over to Elements will give you the chance to bring it up-to-date, make sure it's fully WYSIWYG, and uses the built-in Tailwind CSS theming system.

You can learn more about why your converted Stack must use Tailwind CSS in the [Component Styling](component-styling.md) section of this manual.

# Getting Started

In this getting started guide we'll begin by creating a Custom Component inside of Elements and then look at migrating what we've built into an external DevElement.

### Create a Custom Element

Start a new RapidWeaver Project and go to the "Elements" area in the sidebar. Hit the "+" button next to the "Custom" heading.

# Distribution

Compiled Elements can only be shipped using the RapidWeaver Elements Distribution platform.

RapidWeaver Element Packs (.rwelementpack) are highly optimised encrypted bundles compiled from an RapidWeaver Dev Pack (.rwdevpack) and ready for distribution. Use the developers tools inside of RapidWeaver to convert from a DevPack into a compiled Element Pack and ship it directly to customers.

{% hint style="info" %}
Element Dev packs can be shared and sold publicly, but please be aware these are unencrpted and require RapidWeaver Pro to work.
{% endhint %}

# Palette Icon

The Palette icon is used for converted stacks and native Elements when the Library is viewed as a grid. If your stack doesn't have a Palette icon, Elements will fall back to using the legacy stacks icon from the Resources folder.

### How to Support the Palette Icon

The Palette Icon should be placed in the Stacks "Resources" folder before converting your Stack into an Element.  This image should be named RWpaletteIcon.png and the supported aspect ratio is 2:1 (256x128).

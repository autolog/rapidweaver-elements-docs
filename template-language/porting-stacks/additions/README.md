# Additions

You can distribute your stack with any (or all) of these optional additions and it will not cause any issues as Stacks will simply ignore them. This makes it easy to develop a single addon and distribute it for both the Stacks Plugin and RapidWaver Elements.

The following optional additions should be implemented in your Stack before conversion:

{% content-ref url="framework-key.md" %}
[framework-key.md](framework-key.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="palette-icon.md" %}
[palette-icon.md](palette-icon.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="template-overrides.md" %}
[template-overrides.md](template-overrides.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

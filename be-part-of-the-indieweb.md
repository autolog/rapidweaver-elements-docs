# Be part of the IndieWeb

Realmac Software has always been an indie company and has never taken on outside investment. We've remained an independent and private company for over 20 years. We are and always have been 100% customer funded and focused.

Just like our company, we believe the web should stay open and independent. When you post something on the web, it should [belong to you](https://indieweb.org/own\_your\_data), not a corporation. By joining the indie web movement, your content stays yours and in your control.

You can post anything you want, in any format you want, with no one monitoring you. In addition, you share simple readable links such as _example.com/ideas_. These links are [permanent](https://indieweb.org/permalinks) and will always work.

You can learn more about the [IndieWeb over on the official website](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb).
